                <h3>Here are the observations from training multiple times:<br><br></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="list-main">Having a lot of images for the model to learn a variety of things about Minecraft.</p>
                        This is especially true for the a LoRA like Minecraft which is far from the original model.<br>
                        For example, if there's only one image with a pig and the image is labeled 'pig', it might learn that
                        the whole image is a pig, including the grass, sky etc.. so having multiple images for the same thing is also important.</li>
                    <li><p class="list-main">Having well-labeled images for the model to understand what it's looking at.</p>
                        Since Minecraft things are very different from real life, this is crucial.</li>
                    <li><p class="list-main">Labeling the images without specifying the fact that it's minecraft.</p>
                        I have used a couple tools to generate labels for the images, but it would often specify that it's Minecraft.
                        This doesn't work well for the model, as I wanted to get the minecraft style by simply activating the Minecraft LoRA, without
                        having to specify that it's Minecraft. As such, I labeled the images as if they were real life, which worked well for the output.</li>
                    <li><p class="list-main">Having a good base model with a lot of variety in the images it can generate.</p>
                        This is important to have a good variety of Minecraft-like images.</li>
                    <li><p class="list-main">Training for the right amount of time.</p>
                        Training for too long can lead to broken images, and the same happens if the model is not trained enough. Saving multiple checkpoints is important.</li>    
                </ul>
                Now, this LoRA is far from perfect. If you generate a lot of images, you will start to see similar patterns emerge, and sometimes broken images.
                This is not too surprising since 156 images is not a lot for a whole game. A large model is usually trained on millions of images.<br>
                The way I could improve this model is by training it on more images, and testing more parameters and epochs. Sometimes less training time gets better results.<br><br>
                This LoRA is the 5th version I trained, and it was trained on 512x512 images for 1h on my GPU.<br>
