                <p class="project-main">I trained a LoRA with 156 screenshots from the game Minecraft, and used it to modify an AI model output.<br><br>
                    Here are some examples of the provided images from minecraft and their label for the training:<br>

                        <p>a house in a spruce village, path, torches, grass, blue sky with clouds</p>

                    <br><br>
                    Here are the observations from training multiple times:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="list-main">Having a lot of images for the model to learn a variety of things about Minecraft.</p>
                            This is especially true for the a LoRA like Minecraft which is far from the original model.<br>
                            For example, if there's only one image with a pig and the image is labeled 'pig', it might learn that
                            the whole image is a pig, including the grass, sky etc.. so having multiple images for the same thing is also important.</li>
                        <li><p class="list-main">Having well-labeled images for the model to understand what it's looking at.</p>
                            Since Minecraft things are very different from real life, this is crucial.</li>
                        <li><p class="list-main">Labeling the images without specifying the fact that it's minecraft.</p>
                            I have used a couple tools to generate labels for the images, but it would often specify that it's Minecraft.
                            This doesn't work well for the model, as I wanted to get the minecraft style by simply activating the Minecraft LoRA, without
                            having to specify that it's Minecraft. As such, I labeled the images as if they were real life, which worked well for the output.</li>
                        <li><p class="list-main">Having a good base model with a lot of variety in the images it can generate.</p>
                            This is important to have a good variety of Minecraft-like images.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This LoRA is the 5th version I trained, and it was trained on 512x512 images for 1h on my GPU.<br>
